                <p>Hi! My name's Eduardo Sanchez, but you can call me Eddie! Im 27 years old and from Los Angeles, California. 
                    Grew up in Los Angeles all my life and currently reside in Burbank, California. 
                    Oldest child in my family and have two cute dogs by the name of Maya and Loki! I have worked for
                    a few years for startup tech companies such as Soothe and FinTech Giant Dave. 
                </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <p>I currently work for a small startup company named Dubsado. We're a small crm platform
                    in which we help entrepeneurs achieve their goals and help their business thrive! Working several years in 
                    operational positions and custommer success role, I feel that a transition to a technical role is my next step 
                    for my career. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Hopefully with the coursework from UCLA's extension coding boot camp I am able to build 
                    a strong foundation in order for me to get a better grasp of full stack developement. With some knowledge 
                    of SQL and database structures, I hope to tie that to node and react through the MERN stack here. 
                    I enjoy playing basketball and working out and avid science fiction novel reader! Let's connect!
